categories_field.ft.ee_addon
============================

Categories Field is an ExpressionEngine 2.x fieldtype which can be used to save category IDs to a custom channel entries field. At present there are no 'settings' or 'options', the field simply returns the data from the first categiry group.

This was develop for a specific project to allow a customer to save categories to a custom field and see existing category assignment through the state of the categories list. Non assigned categories are 'muted' in the field display.

There are plans to add matrix compatability and the option to configure this as a select field OR a checkbox array.

This add-on was inspired by Matrix Cat Col (https://github.com/jkoivisto/matrix_cat_col), guided by the work Low has done on Low Freeform Field (https://github.com/low/low_freeform_field) and cribs some UI elements from Pixel & Tonic Matrix (http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/matrix).
